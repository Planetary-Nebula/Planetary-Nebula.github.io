            These are the <b>Instructions</b> for <u>Checkers </u>& <u>Minesweeper</u><br>
            <b><U>Checkers.</U></b> The checkers are moved diagonally forward and each player alternately moves one of their checkers. In order to “capture” an opponent's checker, they must be able to jump (with their own checker) over the opponent's checker when there is an open square behind it.
           <br> <b><u>Minesweeper.</u></b> The object of Minesweeper is to expose all the open areas on the board without hitting an bombs. The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are adjacent to a square. For example, if a square has a "3" on it, then there are 3 bombs next to that square. The bombs could be above, below, right left, or diagonal to the square.
